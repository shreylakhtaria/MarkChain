                                COCOMO MODEL
================================================================================

PROJECT CHARACTERISTICS:
------------------------
- Project Type: Semi-detached (Academic + Blockchain complexity)
- Development Mode: Organic (Small team, familiar domain)
- Language: TypeScript/JavaScript (High-level, modern)
- Platform: Web Application + Blockchain
- Team Experience: Intermediate (Student level)
- Requirements Stability: Stable
- Development Environment: Modern (VS Code, Git, etc.)

SIZE ESTIMATION:
---------------
Actual LOC Analysis from Source Code Only:
- Total Source LOC: ~7,000 lines
- Complexity: High (Blockchain, Cryptography, Real-time features)

COCOMO BASIC MODEL CALCULATIONS:
-------------------------------
Using Organic mode (small team, stable requirements):
- a = 2.4, b = 1.05, c = 2.5, d = 0.38

Effort (E) = a × (KLOC)^b
E = 2.4 × (7.0)^1.05 = 2.4 × 7.35 = 17.6 Person-months

Development Time (TDEV) = c × (E)^d
TDEV = 2.5 × (17.6)^0.38 = 2.5 × 2.8 = 7.0 months

Average Team Size = E / TDEV = 17.6 / 7.0 = 2.5 persons

COCOMO INTERMEDIATE MODEL:
-------------------------
Cost Drivers (Multiplier values):

PRODUCT ATTRIBUTES:
- Required Software Reliability (RELY): 1.08 (Above average - academic data)
- Database Size (DATA): 1.05 (Medium database size)
- Product Complexity (CPLX): 1.25 (High - blockchain integration)

COMPUTER ATTRIBUTES:
- Execution Time Constraint (TIME): 1.00 (Nominal)
- Main Storage Constraint (STOR): 1.00 (Nominal)
- Virtual Machine Volatility (VIRT): 0.90 (Low - stable platforms)
- Computer Turnaround Time (TURN): 0.95 (Good development setup)

PERSONNEL ATTRIBUTES:
- Analyst Capability (ACAP): 1.15 (Below average - student level)
- Applications Experience (AEXP): 1.10 (Below average - new to blockchain)
- Programmer Capability (PCAP): 1.10 (Below average - student level)
- Virtual Machine Experience (VEXP): 1.05 (Below average)
- Programming Language Experience (LEXP): 0.95 (Good - familiar with JS/TS)

PROJECT ATTRIBUTES:
- Use of Software Tools (TOOL): 0.85 (High - modern IDEs, frameworks)
- Application of Software Engineering Methods (SCED): 0.90 (High - good practices)
- Required Development Schedule (SCED): 1.00 (Normal schedule)

Effort Adjustment Factor (EAF) = Product of all multipliers
EAF = 1.08 × 1.05 × 1.25 × 1.00 × 1.00 × 0.90 × 0.95 × 1.15 × 1.10 × 1.10 × 1.05 × 0.95 × 0.85 × 0.90 × 1.00
EAF ≈ 1.42

Adjusted Effort = Basic Effort × EAF = 17.6 × 1.42 = 25.0 Person-months
Adjusted Development Time = 7.0 months 
Adjusted Team Size = 25.0 / 7.0 = 3.6 persons

================================================================================

DEVELOPMENT COST CALCULATION:
----------------------------
Average Student Developer Rate: ₹30,000 per month (Internship level)
Overhead (Tools, Infrastructure): 20% of salary cost

Monthly Cost per Developer: ₹30,000 + 20% = ₹36,000

Total Development Cost:
- Basic COCOMO: 17.6 person-months × ₹36,000 = ₹6,33,600
- Intermediate COCOMO: 25.0 person-months × ₹36,000 = ₹9,00,000

INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS:
--------------------
- Development Tools (Free/Student licenses): ₹5,000
- Cloud Services (Free tiers): ₹10,000
- Domain & Basic Hosting: ₹8,000
- Blockchain Network Costs (Testnet): ₹5,000
- Email Service (Free tier): ₹2,000

Total Infrastructure Cost: ₹30,000

TOTAL PROJECT COST:
------------------
- Conservative Estimate (Basic COCOMO): ₹6,33,600 + ₹30,000 = ₹6,63,600
- Realistic Estimate (Intermediate COCOMO): ₹9,00,000 + ₹30,000 = ₹9,30,000

PROJECT RISK FACTORS:
--------------------
- Technology Risk: HIGH (Blockchain integration, new technology)
- Team Experience: MEDIUM (Student developers with guidance)
- Requirements Change: LOW (Academic project, stable scope)
- Schedule Risk: LOW (Flexible academic timeline)

Contingency Buffer: 15% of total cost (lower for academic project)
Final Cost Estimate: ₹9,30,000 × 1.15 = ₹10,69,500
